  In pursuit of advancing my career in data science, I recently completed a Udacity nanodegree program, acquiring comprehensive knowledge in areas such as data analysis, Version control, visualisation and stastistical modeling.
  <br><br>
  I am proficient in Python programming language, data visualization with excel and data processing and retrieval with SQL. I am interested in working with large datasets, including cleaning, connecting and mining data.
