_I utilized Python to analyze data from bike share systems in three prominent cities of the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I developed code to import and manipulate the data, allowing for the calculation of descriptive statistics to uncover insights. Additionally, I created a script that provides an interactive terminal experience, allowing users to input raw data and receive real-time statistics, enhancing the accessibility and usability of the analysis._
